👋 Hi, I'm Jerome!

🌍 I'm passionate about traveling, photography, and exploring off-the-beaten-path locations around the world. My ideal trip involves discovering hidden gems, soaking in local culture, and capturing those unique moments that make each place special.

🎒 Over the years, I've journeyed through vibrant places like Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. I prefer traveling when it's less crowded, steering clear of tourist traps to find genuine experiences.

📸 Photography is my way of telling stories, from bustling cities to tranquil countryside scenes.

🚆 Whether it's appreciating modern technology like Japan's hybrid trains or marveling at ancient structures beautifully preserved, I believe every journey offers something remarkable.

✍️ This blog is my way of sharing those adventures, tips, and insights. I invite you to join me as I continue exploring, learning, and discovering places around the globe.

Happy travels! 🌏✨
