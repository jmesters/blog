👋 Hi, I'm Jérôme!

🌍 I'm passionate about traveling, photography, and exploring off-the-beaten-path locations around the world. My favorite kind of trip starts the moment I step into a new airport—there’s something exciting about that first breath of unfamiliar air. I’m drawn to sleek trains and futuristic transport, the kind that feels like a glimpse into tomorrow. From there, it’s all about wandering into hidden corners, chasing those unexpected moments that quietly define a place—and trying to catch them in a photo before they slip away. I believe every journey offers something remarkable.

🎒 Over the years, I've journeyed through vibrant places like Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. While I tend to seek out quieter corners, some places are crowded for a reason—and they’re worth experiencing despite the chaos. I’ve found that with the right mindset, you can carry a little bubble of calm with you, even in the thick of it. It might not be peaceful, but it can still be meaningful.

📸 Photography is how I make sense of it all—it’s how I hold onto the moods, textures, and light of a place, from the hum of a neon-lit street to the stillness of an old countryside road.

✍️ This blog is where I share those impressions—short reflections, small tips, and glimpses of what moved me. If you’re into thoughtful travel and curious detours, I’d love to have you along for the ride.

Happy travels! 🌏✨
