Hi! 👋 I'm Jerome, and this is my personal website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

I love:

- 🖥️ Building things with code
- 🌏 Traveling off the beaten path
- 🎮 Playing PC games
- 📸 Capturing moments with photography
- ♟️ Beating friends at chess (or trying to 😄)

This site is my digital home for posts, projects, and random thoughts.

Thanks for stopping by!
